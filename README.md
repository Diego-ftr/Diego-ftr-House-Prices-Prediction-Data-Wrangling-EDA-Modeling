## **Introduction**
House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques is a Kaggle competition aimed at predicting the sale prices of houses
based on a set of features. It is a regression problem, which means that the target variable is a continuous 
numerical value, in this case, the sale price of a property.


## **Understanding the problem**
The goal of this competition is to predict the sale price of a home based on various factors such as the building class, zoning classification, lot size, proximity to main road or railway, the style of dwelling, material and finish quality, age of the house, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other features.

The data is provided in two CSV files, train.csv and test.csv, which contain a total of 79 different features describing the properties. The target variable, SalePrice, is the property's sale price in dollars and will be the variable we aim to predict.

This competition provides an opportunity for participants to apply and improve their regression techniques in a real-world scenario and make predictions about a relevant topic - housing prices. By performing data analysis and modeling on this dataset.

Data Wrangling + EDA
* we will perform some Data Wrangling, the process of cleaning, transforming, and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format that can be more easily analyzed and modeled. It's an important step in any data analysis project, and it can often take up a significant amount of time and resources.

* In this Kaggle competition on House Prices Predictions, we need to perform data wrangling to prepare the dataset for modeling. This will involve handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical ones, removing outliers, and transforming variables if necessary.

* It's crucial to handle these issues effectively as they can impact the accuracy of the final model. We need to make sure that the data is in a format that can be easily used for building predictive models, and that it doesn't contain any inconsistencies or errors that could skew the results.
